# Music Sheet Application 

## *Tiffanie Ang*

This application will allow users to place notes on a music sheet. 
The intended audience is for people who would like to create music 
digitally. 

**Paper vs. Digital Composition**

*Paper*
- It is faster to write music on paper
- However, erasing notes is quite difficult.

*Digital*
- Storing and sharing music becomes easier. 
- You can easily edit mistakes 
- However, these applications are often expensive or are tedious to use. 
  
For this project, I hope to create a music sheet application that will be easier to use. 


## User Stories: 

- As a user, I would like to *add notes* to my music sheet
- As a user, I would like to *remove a note* from my music sheet
- As a user, I would like to view a list of the titles I gave for my music sheet. 
- As a user, I would like to save my music sheet
