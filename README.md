# Music Sheet Application 

## *Tiffanie Ang*

This application will allow users to place notes on a music sheet. 
The intended audience is for people who would like to create music 
digitally. 

**Paper vs. Digital Composition**

*Paper*
- It is faster to write music on paper
- However, erasing notes is quite difficult.

*Digital*
- 

At the same time, I have found that digital music sheet applications 
are often expensive or are tedious to use. I am hoping to create a 
music sheet application that will be easier to use.

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  Note that the IntelliJ markdown previewer doesn't seem to render 
the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
